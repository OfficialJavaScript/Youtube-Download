# Using the application
After doing the previous steps to be able to run the Python file, make sure it's running - It should put out something like this:

```
* Serving Flask app 'app'
* Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
* Restarting with stat
* Debugger is active!
```

This is a good sign, now you want to either go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 or localhost:5000 Both should work (Or just go to the address mentioned in your terminal.)

After navigating to that page you should be met with a nice web interface

Paste a Youtube link into the box, and press download - this process can take a while depending on internet speed and the length of the video.

# Future Updates
* Make logo load instantly (Well ASAP)
* Fix Progress Bar
* Maybe increase download speed
* Add an easier way to change the download location.
