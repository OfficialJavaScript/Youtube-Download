You May do all of the things above, but any recreation please mention me high up in the readme and the code - This is the best way to support me and makes it easier for people to find the original post.

# Unzip the Zip #

3. Right click
4. Extract all
5. Press enter then proceed back to the earlier instructions to install

# Using the application #
After doing the previous steps to be able to run the Python file, make sure it's running - It should put out something like this:

```
* Serving Flask app 'app'
* Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
* Restarting with stat
* Debugger is active!
```

This is a good sign, now you want to either go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) or [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) Both should work (Or just go to the address mentioned in your terminal.)

After navigating to that page you should be met with a nice web interface

Paste a Youtube link into the box, and press download - this process can take a while depending on internet speed and the length of the video.

# Future Updates #
* Make logo load instantly (Well ASAP)
* Fix Progress Bar
* Maybe increase download speed
* Add an easier way to change the download location.

# Legality of this Application #
YouTube video downloaders being legal or illegal is quite a controversial topic, here are some links to articles on this topic (Warning, you will be leaving GitHub, I can not confirm the safety and privacy of these links - enter at your own risk.):
